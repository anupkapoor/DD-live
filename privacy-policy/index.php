    	<h2 class="align-center">Privacy Policy</h2>
		<p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of Dedicated Developers (“we” or “us”). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the <a href="https://dedicateddevelopers.com" target="_blank">https://dedicateddevelopers.com</a>   website (the “Site”), and the ways in which we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our children’s privacy statement, does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect offline and / or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the mail).</p>

<p>You may also want to visit our <a href="https://dedicateddevelopers.com/terms-conditions" target="_self">Terms and Conditions</a> page.</p>

<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy. Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, in which case we’ll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.</p>

<h2>Who do we contact?</h2>

<p>We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site). Dedicated Developers only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the event that they have signed up to receive our free newsletters, have inquired about our services, or have purchased one of our products or services.</p>

<h2>What information do we collect?</h2>

<p>Dedicated Developers collects information in two categories:</p>

<p class="no-spaceing"><strong>1. Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>name and e-mail address – provided by you for registration to receive our free newsletters.</li>
	<li>name, postal address, phone, credit card information as well as whatever information you provide to us so that we may perform the service that you have purchased – provided by you when purchasing our products. This is further expanded up in our Service Agreement Contracts that you would sign when you contract for our services.</li>
	<li>demographic information – used to improve our marketing, products and services.</li>
</ul>

<p class="no-spaceing"><strong>The following types of personal information may be collected, stored, and used: <strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>information, such as your name and email address, that you enter in order to set inquire about our products or service, or when you sign up for our newsletters;</li>
	<li>information, such as your email address, telephone number, name, etc., that you enter when you register with our website;</li>
	<li>information relating to anything you purchase, services you use, or transactions you make through our website, which includes your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card details, or whatever other information is required for us to provide the service to you, etc.;</li>
	<li>information contained in any communications that you send to us by email or through our website, or by any other means, including its communication content and metadata;</li>
	<li>information about your computer including your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, and operating system;</li>
	<li>information about your visits to and use of this website including the referral source, length of visit, page views, and website navigation paths;</li>
	<li>information that is generated while using our website, including when, how often, and under what circumstances you use it;</li>
	<li>any other personal information that you send to us.</li>
</ul>

<p>All such information is strictly protected and used only for delivering the content and products the user has signed up for or purchased, or for finding other individuals who may find our information valuable.</p>

<p><strong>A note about demographic information</strong></p>

<p>We contract with information providers that help us better understand people visiting our sites and advertise to those who find our content relevant. We may share PII with such companies provided that they have explicit policies to not share our data with any other parties and solely for the purpose of helping us understand our customers better. This technique is also called “database marketing”. It is practiced by virtually every US corporation. Every consumer can assume that there is a fair amount of available data about them, including personal data such as buying preferences and education level. There is no central “opt out” place that we are aware of. There are efforts underway to reach a standard that would apply automatically based on browser settings.</p>

<p>We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, statute, law, or regulation, or as required by our banks, payment processors, or financial institutions, or at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and / or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases, based on the relevant law or regulation.</p>

<p>Information is also subject to disclosure if we believe that disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring an action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering (either intentionally or unintentionally) with our rights or property, your rights or property, other users of our website, products or services, or anyone else.</p>

<p><strong>2. Anonymous Usage History (non PII)</strong></p>

<p>We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered preference information before. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as “transparent GIFs”) to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open HTML-formatted email messages.</p>

<p>We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features; advertising that appear on the Site; and, making other offers available to you via email, direct mail or otherwise. We also may provide your information to third parties, such as service providers contractors and other third-parties for a variety of purposes. Note that we not disclose confidential information that you provide to us when engaging our paid services. Further details of this is laid out in our formal contacts.</p>

<p>We do not sell or give your PPI to third parties, except as laid out in this Privacy Policy. For example, we do not give or sell your information to third party marketing companies, nor do we bulk sell PPI to Mailing List Marketers. Be sure to also read the sections included in this Policy regarding specific marketing tools we use, such as Facebook and Google.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online – for example on message boards, web logs, through email, or in chat areas – that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.</p>

<p>Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party’s privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If you have any concerns about a third party’s use of cookies or web beacons or use of your information, you should visit that party’s website and review its privacy policy.</p>

<p>The Site may include links to other websites and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase third-party products or services through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.</p>

<p>Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public.</p>

<p>Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or one or more of our websites is acquired by another company, information about our users may be among the transferred assets.</p>

<h2>Google Analytics</h2>

<p class="no-spaceing">We also use some or all of the Google Analytics Advertiser Features to optimize our business. These features include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Remarketing with Google Analytics</li>
	<li>Google Display Network Impression Reporting</li>
	<li>DoubleClick Platform integrations</li>
	<li>Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>By enabling these Google Analytics Display features, we are required to notify our visitors by disclosing the use of these features and that we and third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to gather data about your activities on our Site.  Among other uses, this allows us to contact you if you begin to fill out our information or check-out forms but abandon it before completion with an email reminding you to complete your order or information request.  The “Remarketing” feature allows us to reach people who previously visited our Site, and match the right audience with the right advertising message. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone’s past visits to the Dedicated Developers family of websites. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google’s privacy policy.</p>

<p>You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s ad settings ( <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads</a>) and / or you may opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page ( <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">http://optout.networkadvertising.org</a> ).</p>

<h2>Facebook</h2>

<p>We sometimes use Facebook for advertising, whether by Facebook ads or through our Facebook page, we, (not Facebook) may collect content or information from a Facebook user and such information may be used in the same manner specified in this Privacy Policy. You consent to our collection of such information.</p>

<p><strong>We abide by Facebook’s Data Use Restrictions</strong></p>

<p>Any ad data collected, received or derived from our Facebook ad (“Facebook advertising data”) is only shared with someone acting on our behalf, such as our service provider. We are responsible for ensuring that our service providers protect any Facebook advertising data or any other information obtained from us, limit our use of all of that information, and keep it confidential and secure.</p>

<p>We do not use Facebook advertising data for any purpose (including retargeting, commingling data across multiple advertisers’ campaigns, or allowing piggybacking or redirecting with tags), except on an aggregate and anonymous basis (unless authorized by Facebook) and only to assess the performance and effectiveness of our Facebook advertising campaigns.</p>

<p>We do not use Facebook advertising data, including the targeting criteria for a Facebook ad, to build, append to, edit, influence, or augment user profiles, including profiles associated with any mobile device identifier or other unique identifier that identifies any particular user, browser, computer or device.</p>

<p>We do not transfer any Facebook advertising data (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived data) to any ad network, ad exchange, data broker or other advertising or monetization related service.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy Statement</h2>

<p>This children’s privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the online collection and use of personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13), and provides important information regarding their rights under federal law with respect to such information.</p>

<ul>
	<li>This Site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we will delete such information from our records.</li>
	<li>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we also do NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties.</li>
	<li>We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through the Site.</li>
	<li>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we do NOT condition the participation of a child under thirteen in the Site’s online activities on providing personally identifiable information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p><strong>Please Note…</strong> (a) third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect or receive information from your website and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads, (b) how users can opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting, and (c) where a user can access a mechanism for exercising such choice (e.g., providing a link to YourAdChoices  <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info" target="_blank">http://optout.aboutads.info</a>  where you can opt out of a variety of online targeted marketing).</p>

<p>The tradeoff between privacy vs. commercial efficiency has a long history, for example the “Do not call” list. In any event, it is likely that either the government or the industry will adopt some form of “opt out” capability in the future to address these concerns.</p>

<p><strong>What are cookies/clear GIFs and how do we use them?</strong></p>

<p>Like many other commercial sites, our site utilizes standard technologies called “cookies” and clear GIFs to collect information about how our Site is used. A cookie is a small data text file, which a website stores on your computer’s hard drive (if your web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Cookies were designed to help a website recognize a user’s browser as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while the user was browsing the site. A cookie cannot be read by a website other than the one that set the cookie. A cookie cannot pass on a computer virus.</p>

<p><strong>Clear GIFs</strong></p>

<p>At times, we work with third-party service partners that employ clear GIFs (also known as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags) for our benefit to help us measure advertising effectiveness. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of our users. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information and only track the visitor traffic and behavior to and on our Site. Clear GIFs can “work with” existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same website or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited “www.companyX.com”, which uses an advertising company’s clear GIF, the website would match the clear GIFs identifier and the advertising company’s cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information can be shared with the advertising company. We do, at times, provide such information to our third-party advertising service partners.</p>

<h2>How do we store your email information?</h2>

<p>Your email information (email address, first name) is stored at the list server that delivers the Dedicated Developers newsletters. Your information can only be accessed by those who help manage those lists in order to deliver e-mail to those who would like to receive our newsletters. All of the newsletters that are sent to you by us include an unsubscribe link in them. You can remove yourself at any time from our newsletters by unsubscribing. If you have purchased any of my programs, you will continue to receive mailings related to your purchase. If you are an affiliate partner, then you will continue to receive mailings related to our affiliate program. If you would like to be removed from any of these mailings, please contact our support team and they can assist you (<a href="mailto:Privacy@DedicatedDevelopers.com" target="_blank">Privacy@DedicatedDevelopers.com</a>). </p>

<h2>How long we’ll keep your information</h2>

<p class="margin-bottom:15">We keep information in line with our data retention policy. For example, if you’re a customer, we’ll normally keep core data for seven years from the end of our relationship. We retain information to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or for our legitimate purposes, such as responding to inquiries, and may sometimes need to keep it for a longer period; if we don’t need to retain it for as long, we may delete, destroy or anonymise it sooner. This enables us to comply with legal and regulatory requirements or use it where we need to for our legitimate purposes such as dealing with any inquiries.</p>

<p>We may need to retain your information for a longer period where we need the information to comply with regulatory or legal requirements or where we may need it for our legitimate purposes, e.g. to help us respond to queries or complaints, fighting fraud and crime, responding to requests from regulators, etc. If we don’t need to retain information for this period of time, we may destroy, delete or anonymise it more promptly.</p>

<p>The GDPR takes effect on May 25,<?php echo date ('Y'); ?>, and is intended to protect the data of European Union citizens.
