		<p>I have worked with Dedicated Developers since 2008. I have hired them and several companies I personally know have hired them to hire designers and developers and we have had great experience with them.

		<p>Working with Dedicated Developers has saved my business 40% to 50% in costs.

		<p>After our first call with Dedicated Developers, they provided us a detailed SOW covering all of the items that we wanted plus their expert inputs.  Ultimately they were able to deliver a clean, crisp looking website before the deadline which they promised at the beginning.
