        	<p>Before I started to work with the developers at Dedicated Developers, I was left to do everything myself in my start-up business. I wanted to focus on the copywriting part of website building and work on growing my business and adding new clients. To do that, I needed to scale the development portion - HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, etc. I had tried outsourcing with other development companies in the past with very limited success.  The deadlines were often missed and people would go missing and be unavailable. Finally, when I started working with Dedicated Developers in 2010, my business really started to take off. I was able to pass off all of the programming work to my DD developer. Each night I send the tasks to my developer and when I get into the office the next morning, everything is ready! It's almost like my business is open 24 / 7, with work getting done overnight. I have been working with Dedicated Developers for over 7 years and I'm always extremely happy with my developer's performance. I work directly with the lead developer and that allows me to work with one person and get him used to my way of doing things. This results in huge time savings and has increased my business profitability. If I didn't have my team at Dedicated Developers, I wouldn't have been able to scale my client base and take on nearly as many projects as we currently have. If you have any software project, I strongly recommend working with Dedicated Developers.</p>

        	<p>I needed a detailed technical feasibility analysis of our project that required strong understanding of the underlying hardware and existing software code.  This was needed to find out if it was the right time to move forward with our project. Dedicated Developers came prepared to meet us and understand our physical hardware project and the project requirements. The project is a combination of hardware and software development and we engaged Dedicated Developers for an in-depth technical feasibility, and project strategy. We were able to meet with their technical architects and immediately felt comfortable that they were the right team to work on our project. I am extremely pleased with the outcome and their approach. We worked through a project management systems along with frequent phone calls and in-office visits. They asked great questions that reflected their deep technological background and provided solutions for any challenges that we faced during our engagement.  I'm excited to find a development partner that has a high level of technical expertise and is professional and friendly in all their dealings. I'd highly recommend companies looking to develop advanced hardware and software projects use Dedicated Developers, they won't be disappointed.

        	<p>I have been designing and building business software applications for about 10 years. Over the years, I have worked with various developers in Ireland as well as in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. None of them were able to deliver a fully functional product within the agreed upon time frame or within a budget that was agreed at the outset. I have been working with Dedicated Developers for the last 3 years and astonishingly, the level of service from them was a million times better than what I experienced with other developers. Competitively, they are second to none. During this time, the Dedicated Developers team worked on a large number of different projects for my company including finishing my first product launch.  They have been excellent at sticking with the promised milestones and budgets, which in itself is a breath of fresh air especially when it comes to working with the developers.  The lead developer I work with is highly professional and has shown a great understanding of our different products, fantastic technical skills, and working with him continues to be a real pleasure.  The project management portal provided by Dedicated Developers makes it easy to keep on top of any project and to exchange ideas with the development team and the project managers. I would highly recommend Dedicated Developers to any business in need of a reliable partner to help you with your mobile and web-based product development projects.

        	<p>I wanted a company to perform a UX Analysis, create Wireframes, and build us a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). There was an idea, but I needed to turn that into a solid MVP. The Dedicated Developers team acted as consultants and provided outstanding brainstorming sessions that improved on our original app concept. The UX Analysis was very detailed and was able to shed light on how to best proceed. The team then created Wireframes that clearly laid out how the app would work, and what the best user flow would be. Dedicated Developers then moved on to create our MVP. They have done an outstanding job and now we can take MVP to complete product development.  We really liked that while working with them we never felt rushed in terms of providing feedback and we could openly discuss our questions and ideas about the project on the phone. We loved the fact they were always available to talk live and were prompt in responding to our questions or ideas via messages. The project management dashboard also allowed us the ease to access ongoing project discussions when it was convenient and even while we were on the go! The project was wrapped up within a timely manner and was completed with the original estimated delivery time. The whole team is really profession-al and friendly, and have been great to work with. We would definitely recommend Dedicated Developers to any business that is looking to take their mobile app idea and turn it into a reality.

        	<p>We were looking for a company to update our E-commerce site and were excited when we found Dedicated Developers. They came to our office to understand our requirements. It was great to connect with professionals personally who really understood our vision for design and what we envisioned. They conducted a thorough UX analysis and were able to articu-late ideas on how to develop a state of the art design, which was then followed up with Wireframes. They were always available to answer any of our questions, were prompt with their email communication, and it was easy to schedule a conference call or an in-person meeting with their team. Their design team was top notch and have been able to capture our strategy and design intent.  Our favorite thing about Dedicated Developers was that they al-ways looked out for our best interests rather than pushing their agenda. We felt super com-fortable working with their team, and with all the dealings we had with them, itâ€™s clear they genuinely work hard for the success of their client's business. I would highly recommend them to anyone needing their website redesigned, especially in the E-commerce space.

        	<p>I needed a detailed technical feasibility analysis of our project that required strong understanding of the underlying hardware and existing software code.  This was needed to find out if it was the right time to move forward with our project. Dedicated Developers came prepared to meet us and understand our physical hardware project and the project requirements. The project is a combination of hardware and software development and we engaged Dedicated Developers for an in-depth technical feasibility, and project strategy. We were able to meet with their technical architects and immediately felt comfortable that they were the right team to work on our project. I am extremely pleased with the outcome and their approach. We worked through a project management systems along with frequent phone calls and in-office visits. They asked great questions that reflected their deep technological background and provided solutions for any challenges that we faced during our engagement.  I'm excited to find a development partner that has a high level of technical expertise and is professional and friendly in all their dealings. I'd highly recommend companies looking to develop advanced hardware and software projects use Dedicated Developers, they won't be disappointed.

        	<p>I have been designing and building business software applications for about 10 years. Over the years, I have worked with various developers in Ireland as well as in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. None of them were able to deliver a fully functional product within the agreed upon time frame or within a budget that was agreed at the outset. I have been working with Dedicated Developers for the last 3 years and astonishingly, the level of service from them was a million times better than what I experienced with other developers. Competitively, they are second to none. During this time, the Dedicated Developers team worked on a large number of different projects for my company including finishing my first product launch.  They have been excellent at sticking with the promised milestones and budgets, which in itself is a breath of fresh air especially when it comes to working with the developers.  The lead developer I work with is highly professional and has shown a great understanding of our different products, fantastic technical skills, and working with him continues to be a real pleasure.  The project management portal provided by Dedicated Developers makes it easy to keep on top of any project and to exchange ideas with the development team and the project managers. I would highly recommend Dedicated Developers to any business in need of a reliable partner to help you with your mobile and web-based product development projects.

        	<p>I wanted a company to perform a UX Analysis, create Wireframes, and build us a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). There was an idea, but I needed to turn that into a solid MVP. The Dedicated Developers team acted as consultants and provided outstanding brainstorming sessions that improved on our original app concept. The UX Analysis was very detailed and was able to shed light on how to best proceed. The team then created Wireframes that clearly laid out how the app would work, and what the best user flow would be. Dedicated Developers then moved on to create our MVP. They have done an outstanding job and now we can take MVP to complete product development.  We really liked that while working with them we never felt rushed in terms of providing feedback and we could openly discuss our questions and ideas about the project on the phone. We loved the fact they were always available to talk live and were prompt in responding to our questions or ideas via messages. The project management dashboard also allowed us the ease to access ongoing project discussions when it was convenient and even while we were on the go! The project was wrapped up within a timely manner and was completed with the original estimated delivery time. The whole team is really profession-al and friendly, and have been great to work with. We would definitely recommend Dedicated Developers to any business that is looking to take their mobile app idea and turn it into a reality.

        	<p>We were looking for a company to update our E-commerce site and were excited when we found Dedicated Developers. They came to our office to understand our requirements. It was great to connect with professionals personally who really understood our vision for design and what we envisioned. They conducted a thorough UX analysis and were able to articu-late ideas on how to develop a state of the art design, which was then followed up with Wireframes. They were always available to answer any of our questions, were prompt with their email communication, and it was easy to schedule a conference call or an in-person meeting with their team. Their design team was top notch and have been able to capture our strategy and design intent.  Our favorite thing about Dedicated Developers was that they al-ways looked out for our best interests rather than pushing their agenda. We felt super com-fortable working with their team, and with all the dealings we had with them, itâ€™s clear they genuinely work hard for the success of their client's business. I would highly recommend them to anyone needing their website redesigned, especially in the E-commerce space.
